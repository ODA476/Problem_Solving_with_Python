*4.20 (Science: wind-chill temperature) Exercise 2.9 gives a formula to compute the
wind-chill temperature. The formula is valid for temperatures in the range
between and 41Â°F and for wind speed greater than or equal to 2. Write a
program that prompts the user to enter a temperature and a wind speed.
The program displays the wind-chill temperature if the input is valid; otherwise,
it displays a message indicating whether the temperature and/or wind speed is invalid.
